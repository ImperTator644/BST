Decided to implement given data structure as Binary Search Tree.

# Task 1 - countLeafs(BNode node) method.
Counts all the leaf nodes of the tree.

# Task 2 - largestNumOfEdges(BNode node) and calulateEdge(BNode node) methods.
Count the longest path from root node to leaf node.

# Task 3 - equals(Object otherObject) method.
